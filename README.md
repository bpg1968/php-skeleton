# PHP-SKELETON

PHP-Skeleton is a MVC skeleton application based on Slim Framework (http://www.slimframework.com/). This project
was inspired by **php-mvc** (https://github.com/panique/php-mvc/). 
PHP-Skeleton is a bundling of the following components. 

* **Model**: idiorm ([j4mie/idiorm](https://github.com/j4mie/idiorm))
* **View**: Twig ([fabpot/Twig](https://github.com/fabpot/Twig))
* **Controller/Routing**: Slim ([codeguy/Slim](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim))
* **Debugging**: Kint ([raveren/kint](https://github.com/raveren/kint))

## Why does this project exist ?

One of the biggest question in the PHP world is "How do I build an application ?".
It's hard to find a good base, a good file structure and useful information on that, but at the same time
there are masses of frameworks that might be really good, but really hard to understand, hard to use and extremely
complex. This project tries to be some kind of naked skeleton bare-bone for quick application building.

## Structure

* **application/** contains all files for your app: `models/`, `routers/`, `views/` (Twig templates), `libs/` (Internal libraries) and your `config/` (configuration).
* **data/** contains data such as cache and uploads.
* **public/** is for your assets: js/css/img files.
* **vendor/** contains the external libraries for your application. (Used for Composer)
